:: Green Captain
This captain is different from most. There are no distinct features nor does he resemble anyone of importance. 
It is almost as if he is but a crew member rather than a captain. 
To those who know him he is called The Derilect, a name given to him because of how he drifts across the ocean with what seems to be with no care in the world.
